This repository contains an example implementation of FreeRTOS in Tickless Idle and low power mode of the STM32U575ZI-Q. Therefore the NULCEO-U575ZI-Q Discovery Board is used.
The implementation is based on the work of Jeff Tenney "FreeRTOS Tick/Tickless via LPTIM". The Repo can be found here: https://github.com/jefftenney/LPTIM-Tick.

The Software is setup with STM32CubeIDE v1.10.1 using CubeMX with HAL/LL libraries.

WIP!
